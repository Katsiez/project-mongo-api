# Mongo API Project

For this project, I have used MongoDB to build a database to store data and later on manipulated it with mongoose.

## Endpoints:

*/* Initial page
*/books* - lists all the books
*/books/find/:bookID* - finds books by id
*/books/isbn/:isbn* - finds books by isnb number
*/books/authors/:author* - finds books by author

## View it live
